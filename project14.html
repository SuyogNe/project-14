    <code>Cake</code> is a flour confection made from <code>flour, sugar, and other ingredients</code> and is usually baked. In their oldest forms,
     cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate and
      which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.The most <code>common ingredients</code> include
       flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil, or margarine), a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking
        powder. Common <code>additional ingredients</code> include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla,
         with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with <mark>fruit preserves, nuts, or dessert
          sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream, or syrups), iced with buttercream or other icings</mark>, and
           decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.<br>
        <mark>Many cake factories and bakeries can be supervisioned by the <abbr title="Department of Food Technology and Quality Control ">DFTQC</abbr> .</mark></p><br><hr><br>
